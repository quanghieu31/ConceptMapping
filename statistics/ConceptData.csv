Estimate,"Not fixed number. Use data to learn the properties for a sample. A sophisticated ""guess"".",Random variables,A variable that takes values according to a certain probability distribution,
Parameter,Fixed number. Maybe aka the population stats.,Other,,
Univariate distribution,"A univariate distribution refers to the distribution of a single random variable. In other words, it describes the way in which the values of a single variable are spread or distributed. The term ""univariate"" emphasizes that we are focusing on the analysis of a single variable in isolation.",Distribution,"Refers to the way in which values of a variable are spread or distributed across a range. It provides information about the possible values a variable can take and the likelihood of each value occurring.
- Can be derived from data directly (without any assumption of the distribution)
- At the same time, use distribution to define data: yes, I know, I am confused about this too. But essentially, you look at the given data and decide hmm what distribution might best represent the data... for example: grades in a course might be a normal distribution and use properties of a normal dist to understand the distribution of grades",
CDF,"All random variables (both discrete and continuous) have it.
- F(c) ≡ Pr(X ≤ c)
- 0 ≤ F(x) ≤ 1
- If xj < xk then F(xj) ≤ F(xk)
- derivative of F(x) is f(x)",Univariate distribution,,A type of dist
PMF,"All DISCRETE random variables have it.
- f(c) ≡ Pr(X = c)
- 0 ≤ f(c) ≤ 1 for ∀c
- Sum of f(x) for ∀x is 1
- Sum f(x_i) from i=1 to j = F(x_j)",Univariate distribution,,A type of dist
PDF,"All CONTINUOUS variables have it.
- f (x) ≥ 0 for ∀x
- f(x) is not a probability and can be > 1
- Pr(x = x0) = integral of f(x)dx from x0 to x0 = F(x0) - F(x0) = 0
- Pr(x = some_x) = integral of given f(x)",Univariate distribution,,A type of dist
Expected value,"First moment or Mean
E(x) ≡ µ
- Discrete: Sum of x_i * f(x_i) for all x_i
- Continous: Integral of x * f(x)

Properties:
- If c is a constant, E(c) = c and E(cx) = cE(x)",Moments,"Central moments

There are examples of distributions that do not have particular moments. Something like:
- zeta distribution and Riemann's zeta function
- Cauchy distribution",
Variance,"Second moment
E((x−µ)^2) ≡ σ^2
- Discrete: Sum of (x_i - µ)^2 * f(x_i) for all x_i
- Continous: Integral of (x-µ)^2 * f(x)

Properties:
- Var(x) = σ^2
- If y=a+bx, then Var(y) = b^2 * Var(x)
- Var(constant) = 0
- σ^2 = E((x-µ)^2) = E(x^2) - µ^2 = E(x^2) - (E(x))^2",Moments,,
Standard deviation,"Normally, variance is for each observation which is how different it is from mean. 

Standard deviation is just a number for a distribution that is the most average of all observations.",Variance,,
Skewness,"Third moment

- if skewness is positive, distribution is skewed to right
- if skewness is negative, distribution is skewed to left
