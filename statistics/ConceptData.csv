Estimate,"Not fixed number. Use data to learn the properties for a sample. A sophisticated ""guess"".",Random variables,A variable that takes values according to a certain probability distribution,
Parameter,Fixed number. Maybe aka the population stats.,Other,,
Event,"An event is any subset of the sample space, including any singleton set (an elementary event), the empty set (an impossible event, with probability zero) and the sample space itself (a certain event, with probability one). 

Examples of an event in a 52-card deck:
- ""A King"" (4 elements)
- ""The 5 of Hearts"" (1 element)
- ""A Spade"" (13 elements)
- ""A red/black card"" (0 element)",Other,,
Univariate distribution,"A univariate distribution refers to the distribution of a single random variable. In other words, it describes the way in which the values of a single variable are spread or distributed. The term ""univariate"" emphasizes that we are focusing on the analysis of a single variable in isolation.",Distribution,"Refers to the way in which values of a variable are spread or distributed across a range. It provides information about the possible values a variable can take and the likelihood of each value occurring.
- Can be derived from data directly (without any assumption of the distribution)
- At the same time, use distribution to define data: yes, I know, I am confused about this too. But essentially, you look at the given data and decide hmm what distribution might best represent the data... for example: grades in a course might be a normal distribution and use properties of a normal dist to understand the distribution of grades",
Cumulative distribution function,"All random variables (both discrete and continuous) have it.
- F(c) ≡ Pr(X ≤ c)
- 0 ≤ F(x) ≤ 1
- If xj < xk then F(xj) ≤ F(xk)
- derivative of F(x) is f(x)",Univariate distribution,,A type of dist
Probability mass function,"All DISCRETE random variables have it.
- f(c) ≡ Pr(X = c)
- 0 ≤ f(c) ≤ 1 for ∀c
- Sum of f(x) for ∀x is 1
- Sum f(x_i) from i=1 to j = F(x_j)",Univariate distribution,,A type of dist
Probability distribution function,"All CONTINUOUS variables have it.
- f (x) ≥ 0 for ∀x
- f(x) is not a probability and can be > 1
- Pr(x = x0) = integral of f(x)dx from x0 to x0 = F(x0) - F(x0) = 0
- Pr(x = some_x) = integral of given f(x)",Univariate distribution,,A type of dist
Expected value,"First moment or Mean
E(x) ≡ µ
- Discrete: Sum of x_i * f(x_i) for all x_i
- Continous: Integral of x * f(x)

Properties:
- If c is a constant, E(c) = c and E(cx) = cE(x)",Moments,"Central moments. Almost every distribution has some or all of the moments.

There are examples of distributions that do not have particular moments. Something like:
- zeta distribution and Riemann's zeta function
- Cauchy distribution",
Variance,"Second moment
E((x−µ)^2) ≡ σ^2
- Discrete: Sum of (x_i - µ)^2 * f(x_i) for all x_i
- Continous: Integral of (x-µ)^2 * f(x)

Properties:
- Var(x) = σ^2
- If y=a+bx, then Var(y) = b^2 * Var(x)
- Var(constant) = 0
- σ^2 = E((x-µ)^2) = E(x^2) - µ^2 = E(x^2) - (E(x))^2",Moments,,
Standard deviation,"Normally, variance is for each observation which is how different it is from mean. 

Standard deviation is just a number for a distribution that is the most average of all observations.",Variance,,
Skewness,"Third moment

- if skewness is positive, distribution is skewed to right
- if skewness is negative, distribution is skewed to left

Very important, please dig deeper",Moments,,
Normal distribution,"Normal distribution or Gaussian distribution. 
Described by mean and variance. The famous bell curve.

Standard normal dist: mean = 0 and var = 1

Related to central limit theorem, hypothesis testing,…",Univariate distribution,,
Poisson distribution,"A discrete probability distribution. Given a lambda number of events (expected mean/rate of occurrences) in a given interval, the probability of k independent events in the same interval has Poisson distribution. 

Examples:
- On a particular river, overflow floods occur once every 100 years on average (lambda = 1, interval = 100 years). Calculate the probability of k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 overflow floods in a 100 year interval, assuming the Poisson model is appropriate.
- It has been reported that the average number of goals in a World Cup soccer match is approximately 2.5 and the Poisson model is appropriate.

It is the limit of a binomial distribution?
- The events being modeled must be rare. Or, the prob of success (p) in each trial of the binomial distribution should be small and number of trials (n) should be large.  as n approaches infinity and p approaches 0 in such a way that the product np remains constant (=lambda), the binomial distribution converges to a Poisson distribution.
- Constant rate of occurrence or lambda should be finite.
- Number of successes and events in a fixed number of trials or a fixed interval",Univariate distribution,,
Exponential distribution,"Is the probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

It is often used to describe the distribution of time until the next event in a sequence of independent events.

Memoryless property: Conditional probability of an event occurring within a specific future time interval is independent of the past. Mathematically, 
P(X>s+t∣X>s)=P(X>t)

Example: distribution of a lifetime of a lightbulb: the probability of a lightbulb to last in the next hours does not depend on itself or historical operational hours. The exponential distribution emphasizes the constant hazard/failure rate. This means the conditional probability of failure (the bulb dies) is the same regardless of the operational hours (0 vs 500 hours). 

Why exponential distribution skewed?
- Exponential decay: term e^(-x)
- Memoryless property: 
Constant Probability of Waiting: The memoryless property implies a constant probability per unit of time. It's like saying there's always a certain chance of the event happening in the next minute, no matter how much time has passed.
No Accumulated Probability: The lack of memory means that the distribution doesn't ""accumulate"" probability towards the right. Even if you've already waited for a while, the distribution doesn't become more likely to make you wait longer",Univariate distribution,,
Uniform distribution,"Suppose x ∈ [a, b] is a uniformly distributed continuous random
variable. Then F(x) is a one-to-one function between x and p, which must be on [0, 1]
Mathematical fact: If p = F(x) is a one-to-one function, then it has
an inverse F^(−1)(p) = x

Very important: If x is any continuous random variable,
then p ≡ F(x) is a uniformly distributed random variable on [0, 1]
=> For data simulation

Meaning: every value is equally probable",Univariate distribution,,
Binomial distribution,"The binomial distribution is the sum of binary random variables. It
depends on p, the probability that a single variable is one, n is the
number of different binary variables, and k is the number of cases in
which our random variable equals one.
The binomial distribution has a pmf like this:
(n chooses k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Mean = np
Variance = np(1-p)",Univariate distribution,,
Log-normal distribution,,Univariate distribution,,
Cauchy distribution,,Univariate distribution,,
Bernoulli random variables,"Binary (or Bernoulli) random variables are important in social
sciences: examples include female or male, employed or not, dead or
alive.
The interesting bit about binary variables is they can be completely
described by one parameter, p = f (1).
The pmf of binary random variable is just f (0) = (1 − p) and
f (1) = p with a cdf of F(0) = 1 − p and F(1) = 1.

- E(x) = p
- Var(x) = p(1-p)",Univariate distribution,,
Chi-squared distribution,"A special case of gamma function

Summing the squares of independent standard normal random variables. I am at first skeptical about why it's univariate but not multi, and it's because it refers to the same domain of different variables/categories. i.e. books of various genres.

Usually used in multiple categories of a domain/normal distribution for hypothesis testing, i.e. test to see if some genres of books have more customers than others",Univariate distribution,,
t-distribution,"The t-distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to the standard normal distribution, but it has heavier tails. As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution. The t-distribution is commonly used in hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals, especially when dealing with small sample sizes.",Univariate distribution,,
