+ follow bivariate and multivariate analysis on Wikipedia
+ estimation pt1 and estimation pt2 (lecture slides 3 and 5)
+ experiment (lecture slides 4) - focus on treatment/control analysis, RCT, matching, propensity score
+ distribution of estimates (very weird) (lecture 6)
+ data, types, sampling, measurement errors, admin data (lecture 7)
